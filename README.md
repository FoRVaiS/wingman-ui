# Wingman UI
Wingman UI is the frontend component of the [Wingman](https://github.com/FoRVaiS/wingman/) project, which is hosted as a submodule of the main project repository.

## Development
While the UI is designed to work in conjunction with the rest of the Wingman system, it is a standalone project and can be developed independently. This means that it can introduce breaking changes without impacting the overall functionality of the system.
